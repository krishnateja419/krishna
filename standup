Hi Team,

I fixed the errors for the logic to  implement  delete method script line to delete the default JMX_OPTS env variable and now it's  append new value SSL and auth true. Spined up EC2 instance and navigated to the path and the script is now have value s as true. Need to implement same logic in publisher sites and  also checking to find a way to validate the JVM that set to be true .

Analysied the existing process of how ACT is integrated to AEM libraries for JMX to monitor
2)	Identified the code of sample java function to trigger the domain mock test.
3)	Identified the process to implement the validation env.
1)	Need to add JMX funtion inside https://github.com/Netcentric/accesscontroltool/blob/develop/accesscontroltool-bundle/src/main/java/biz/netcentric/cq/tools/actool/jmx/AceServiceMBeanImpl.java
2)	Clone this public t internal project and customize it 
3)	Add the JMX function here to perform the action
4)	Install add dependency maven inside AEM component library

Hi cam,
Regarding the new jmx panel. I was trying to customise the ACTool by removing all features of ACT like access control to only get the panel and new functions to implement and then generate a package with own Gitlab project and push to artifactory. Then we can install this package inside aem component library like how we did for ACT. Please correct me my understanding is correct or you are expecting to build code inside AEM component library to connect exist JMX and then on top of that build new set of functions?
